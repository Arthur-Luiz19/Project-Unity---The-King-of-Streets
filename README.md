# Hello!!
I'm Arthur Luiz, brazilian game developer and creator this game "The King of Streets". That is my second game 2D than i developed on Unity Engine.

For a development this game, i was inspired by Snes and Mega Drive games, such a Final Fight, Street of Rage and Captain Commando, for development this game.
It's a being a challenge for me, because i wasn't use to this programming logic, but all is apprenticeship, so i want to shere my knowledge for here.
